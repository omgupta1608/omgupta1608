## Hello! Looks like you're interested in what I do. Here's a synopsis:

I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience working on Backend Systems and the Cloud. My skills as an engineer are summarized as icons below. Apart from Software I love to read, write and learn more and more about Physics and Astronomy as a hobby.


I am currently learning (or at least trying to learn) Rust ðŸ¦€ and how CPUs, the Operating System, or basically how computer systems work under the hood.
